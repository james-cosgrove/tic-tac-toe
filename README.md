### Overview

### Requirements

- Render a game in the browser
- Switch turns between two players
- Design logic for winning & visually display which player won
- Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files
- Stick with KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles
- Use Javascript or jQuery for DOM manipulation
- Deploy your game online, where the rest of the world can access it
- Use semantic markup for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)

--

### Technologies Used

 - HTML, CSS, JavaScript

--

### White-boarding/Initial planning

### Process/Approach Taken



### Overview

Make a front end Tic Tac Toe app  

---

### Challenges

 - Limited time constraints
 - Trying to keep code dry whilst meeting the design brief
 -
 - The project would have benefited from the use of a project leader/coordinator to help guide logistics

---

### Future Expansion (Stretch Goals)
 - Make my app fully responsive
 - Implement a solution that enable to play game on different size game board. I already have a separate branch ('arbitrary-board-size') where I am working on this. So far I haven't been able to come up with an algorithm to find 3 in a row on a 4x4 or 5x5 size grid although I have implemented DOM manipulation to change board sizes.
